Instructions-
For trigonometric functions- use function....angle in brackets
For inverse functions use arc...
For log functions, enter base before brackets like loga(x) where b is base
*Note log(x) will be taken as log base e*
For exponents use e**x or e^x

Don't use x as multiplication symbol
Enter equation->
f(x)=xlog(x)
Enter range- (a to b) -> 0 to 10
